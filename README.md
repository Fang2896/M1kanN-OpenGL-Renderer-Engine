## Introduction

Mikann Renderer Engine is a OpenGL based renderer engine for rendering algorithm showcases.



## Features

### Basic Features

* [x] Camera Movement
* [x] Using `Assimp` load model
* [ ] Skybox loading
* [ ] Scene Manger (using scene tree)

* [ ] Text Rendering




### Functions

* [ ] Basic shapes
  (Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Plane, Quad and so on.)
* [ ] Lightings and Objects transform configure system
* [ ] Visualizing **Depth Buffer**
* [ ] Using **Stencil Testing** to draw objectsâ€™ outlining
* [ ] Transparent Object Rendering : Clipping and Blending 
  (draw a plane of grass and half transparent glass)
* [ ] Using Frame Buffer to renderer scene to a texture
  Then Post Processing
* [ ] High level GLSL (half-side rendering etc.)
* [ ] Using Geometry shader to visualize normal
* [ ] Anti Aliasing
* [ ] Occlusion Culling and Frustum Culling



### Rendering Features

* [x] Blinn-Phong lighting 
* [ ] Reflection and Refraction shader
* [ ] Gamma Correction
* [ ] Shadow
* [ ] Normal Mapping and Displacement Mapping
* [ ] HDR
* [ ] Blooming
* [ ] SSAO
* [ ] Deferred shading
* [ ] PBR
